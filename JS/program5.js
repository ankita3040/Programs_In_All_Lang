// The new operator is used to create an instance of an object.
//  To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method.

//In the following example, the constructor methods are Object(), Array(),
//  and Date(). These constructors are built-in JavaScript functions.


var emp = new Object();
var Arr = new Array("C, C++,Jva");
var date = new Date("August  15,1997")

console.log(emp)
console.log(Arr)
console.log(date)

console.log(typeof(emp))
console.log(typeof(Arr))
console.log(typeof(date))
